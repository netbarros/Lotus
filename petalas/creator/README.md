    "membership_management",
    "online_booking",
    "payment_processing",
    "instructor_profiles",
    "attendance_tracking",
    "mobile_pwa"
  ],
  microPetalas: [
    "auth-basic",
    "auth-social",
    "appointment-booking",
    "subscriptions",
    "payment-stripe",
    "rbac-advanced"
  ],
  compliance: ["GDPR"],
  estimatedTime: "14 minutes"
}
```
